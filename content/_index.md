# What is Aggregate Computing<small>[1]</small>?

<img src="./images/acDevices.svg" width=60%>

A macro-programming approach that defines the **collective behavior** of a heterogeneous set of devices in a **self-organizing system**.
<!-- Based on the **Field Calculus**<small>[2]</small>, operates by manipulating distributed data structures called *fields*. -->

# Simulating _Aggregate Computing_ systems

Simulations are part of the **development cycle**.

**Scalability limitation**: </br>challenges in scaling simulations to hundreds or more devices simultaneously.

Simulations _must_ be reactive also on high scales.

# Alternatives?

- Create a new language: external DSL
- Hide the problem at runtime
